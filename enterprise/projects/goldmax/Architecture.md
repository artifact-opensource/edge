### Layer 2 — Context Vector ($c$)

Constructing the comprehensive input vector that represents the current market state.

$c = [\text{price history}, \text{volume}, \text{technical indicators}, \text{order book features}, \text{macro signals}, \text{sentiment}, \text{temporal features}]$

*   **Sequence Length:** The number of past intervals (N) included in the context vector, a crucial hyperparameter.
*   **Optional Embeddings:**
    *   Encoding sentiment or text news into dense vector representations.
    *   Encoding correlated assets into embeddings for neural network inputs.

**High-level abstraction:** The context vector $c$ is a multi-dimensional snapshot of everything currently known about the market state, providing the basis for prediction.

---

### Layer 3 — Candidate Space ($\mathcal{C}$)

Defining the set of all possible actions or outcomes the system can select from.

1.  **Simple Discrete Moves**
    *   Up / Down / Flat: The most basic directional predictions.

2.  **Granular Price Bins**
    *   Example: Next 0.1% movement steps, offering more precise price targets.

3.  **Expected Returns / Regression Output**
    *   Predicting a continuous percentage return. This output must be mapped to discrete bins if the argmax function requires a discrete candidate space.

4.  **Optional Multi-step Trajectory**
    *   Predicting the price movement over the next K intervals (sequence prediction).
    *   **Tradeoff:** The candidate space grows exponentially with K, requiring significantly more data and computational resources.

**Key:** The candidate space $\mathcal{C}$ must be enumerable to ensure that the argmax operation is computationally feasible.

---

### Layer 4 — Scoring Function ($S(x \mid c)$)

The core of the system, responsible for assigning a likelihood or utility score to each candidate $x$ given the context $c$.

**Option 1 — Statistical / Frequency-Based**
*   **Method:** Count occurrences of candidate $x$ given similar contexts in historical data.
*   **Probability Estimation:**
    $S(x \mid c) \approx \frac{\text{count}(x \text{ in similar context})}{\text{count(similar context)}}$
*   **Pros:** Simple, highly interpretable.
*   **Cons:** Limited generalization, sensitive to noise and rare events.

*   **Input:** The context vector $c$.
*   **Output:** A probability distribution over the candidate space $\mathcal{C}$.
*   **Characteristics:** Handles moderate context dimensionality, fast training and inference, provides interpretable feature importance.

**Option 3 — Neural Networks**
*   **Models:**
    *   **LSTM / GRU:** Ideal for sequential modeling of price, volume, and indicators.
    *   **Transformer:** Utilizes attention mechanisms over multi-dimensional context (market, sentiment, macro).
*   **Input:** The full context vector $c$.
*   **Output:** A score for each candidate $x \in \mathcal{C}$.
*   **Pros:** Can model complex non-linear and long-range dependencies.
*   **Cons:** Requires vast amounts of data, computationally intensive to train.

*   **Method:** Multiply the raw probability by an expected return, inverse variance, or a Sharpe-adjusted metric.
*   **Formula:**
    $S(x \mid c) = P(x \mid c) \cdot \frac{E[R_x]}{\sigma_x}$
*   **Purpose:** Incorporates risk-reward considerations directly into the scoring, making signals more actionable.

### Layer 5 — Argmax / Prediction

The final step in the input pipeline, where the optimal candidate is selected.

$\hat{x} = \arg\max_{x \in \mathcal{C}} S(x \mid c)$

*   **Output:** The best candidate $\hat{x}$.
*   **Optional:** Return top-k candidates along with their confidence scores for richer downstream processing.
