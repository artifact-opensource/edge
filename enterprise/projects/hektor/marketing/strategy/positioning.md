# HEKTOR Market Positioning
> **The World's First Spectral Vector Database**

## Core Positioning Statement

HEKTOR is the first spectral/perceptual vector database that combines sub-millisecond performance with HDR-aware quantization for billion-scale AI applications requiring both speed and perceptual accuracy.

### Why It Matters

Traditional vector databases optimize for mathematical distance. HEKTOR optimizes for **human perception** - critical for visual AI, medical imaging, agriculture, and any domain where "similar" means "looks/feels similar to humans."

## Market Category

**Primary**: Vector Database / Embedding Store  
**Secondary**: Spectral/Perceptual Database (new category we're creating)  
**Tertiary**: AI Infrastructure / MLOps Platform

**Category Creation**: We're defining "spectral database" as the category. We own it.
