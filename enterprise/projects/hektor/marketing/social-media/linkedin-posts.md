## Week 1: Foundation

### Day 1 - Launch Announcement
**Theme**: Product introduction

◉ Introducing HEKTOR - the world's first spectral vector database.

Sub-millisecond vector search with HDR-aware perceptual quantization for billion-scale AI applications.

Key capabilities:
• 2.9ms p99 latency (30-60% faster than alternatives)
• 98.1% recall@10 with perceptual quantization
• Billion-vector scale with kinetic sharding
• Self-hosted, MIT licensed, production-ready

Why "spectral"? Because not all vectors are created equal. Medical imaging, agricultural sensors, remote sensing - these applications need databases that understand perception and spectra, not just mathematical distance.

### Day 3 - Technical Depth
**Theme**: Perceptual quantization

What is perceptual quantization and why does it matter?

Traditional vector databases use product quantization (PQ) optimized for mathematical compression. HEKTOR uses perceptual quantization - compression optimized for human perception.

The difference:
• Standard PQ: 95.2% recall@10
• Perceptual PQ: 98.1% recall@10
• +3% improvement where it matters most

Based on SMPTE ST 2084 (Dolby Vision) and Rec. 2100 HLG curves from HDR video encoding.

Perfect for:
→ Image similarity search
→ Visual recommendations
→ Medical imaging AI
→ Fashion/design applications

Perceptual accuracy > Mathematical distance.

### Day 5 - Performance Benchmark
**Theme**: Speed comparison

We benchmarked HEKTOR against leading vector databases. Results:

■ p99 Latency (100M vectors):
• HEKTOR: 2.9ms
• Competitor A: 5.2ms
• Competitor B: 8.1ms
• Competitor C: 10.3ms

That's 44-72% faster than alternatives.

Why it matters:
→ Real-time recommendations (< 10ms)
→ Interactive search experiences
→ Higher QPS on same hardware
→ Lower cloud costs

Technical details:
• SIMD-optimized HNSW
• AVX-512 vectorization (9x speedup)
• Zero-copy operations
• Perceptually-optimized quantization

## Week 2: Use Cases

### Day 8 - Medical Imaging
**Theme**: Domain application

Medical imaging AI requires more than standard vector search.

The challenge:
→ Perceptual similarity matters (not just pixel distance)
→ False negatives are costly
→ HIPAA compliance required
→ Color accuracy is critical

HEKTOR's approach:
✓ Perceptual quantization (98.1% recall)
✓ Color space support (CIEDE2000, LAB, LCH)
✓ Quantum-resistant encryption
✓ Self-hosted (data sovereignty)

Use cases:
• Similar case retrieval
• Diagnostic decision support
• Training data curation
• Quality assurance

Launching spectral features Q2 2026: hyperspectral support, psychophysical models.

### Day 10 - Fashion/E-commerce
**Theme**: Domain application

Visual search for fashion requires understanding human perception.

What customers see:
→ "This dress feels similar to that one"
→ Color harmony and style
→ Texture and pattern similarity

What standard databases see:
→ Mathematical distance between embeddings
→ No understanding of perceptual similarity

HEKTOR bridges this gap:
• Perceptual quantization (human-aligned similarity)
• Color-accurate matching (Q2: CIEDE2000 support)
• Sub-3ms queries (real-time UX)
• Billion-scale catalog support

Result: Better recommendations, higher conversion, happier customers.

Fashion tech builders: Early access available.

### Day 12 - Agriculture & Remote Sensing
**Theme**: Domain application

Agricultural AI and satellite imaging need spectral understanding.

The gap:
→ Hyperspectral data (10-200 bands, not just RGB)
→ Material identification by spectral signature
→ Vegetation health, soil analysis, crop monitoring
→ Standard databases see vectors, not spectra

HEKTOR roadmap (Q4 2026):
✓ Hyperspectral wavelength processing
✓ Spectral signature extraction
✓ Material classification (Spectral Angle Mapper)
✓ Support for ENVI, GeoTIFF, HDF5

Use cases:
• Crop disease detection
• Soil composition analysis
• Irrigation optimization
• Yield prediction

AgTech + GIS builders: Partnership program open.

### Day 17 - Kinetic Sharding Explained
**Theme**: Technical innovation

Introducing Kinetic Sharding - adaptive partitioning for skewed workloads.

The problem:
→ Static sharding creates hotspots
→ 80/20 workloads (some data is queried 100x more)
→ Manual rebalancing is reactive and slow

Kinetic Sharding solution:
✓ ML-based workload prediction
✓ Automatic split/merge decisions
✓ Query pattern analysis
✓ Cost-benefit optimization

Benefits:
• 40-60% latency reduction for skewed workloads
• 30% cost savings (right-sized partitions)
• Self-healing under load shifts
• No manual intervention

Novel technique - paper submission in progress.

### Day 19 - Security & Privacy
**Theme**: Technical feature

Quantum-resistant security for AI infrastructure.

The threat:
→ Quantum computers will break RSA/ECC
→ "Store now, decrypt later" attacks
→ Long-lived AI training data at risk

HEKTOR's approach (Q2 2026):
✓ CRYSTALS-Kyber (NIST standard)
✓ Post-quantum TLS
✓ 7-35x faster than RSA
✓ Future-proof encryption

Plus privacy options:
• Intel SGX enclaves (data invisibility)
• Homomorphic encryption (query on encrypted data)
• Multi-party computation

Compliance:
✓ GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC2
