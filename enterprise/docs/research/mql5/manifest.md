## Overview
This manifest catalogs the candidate MQL5 articles to be saved into per-phase directories under `docs/mql5_handbook/` (one article per markdown file + assets). It’s organized by the project’s Phase map in `docs/development_log/build_plan.md` to ensure Phase 1–3 coverage. Per-phase manifests are:

- `phase1/manifest.md` — Phase 1 (foundation) articles
- `phase2/manifest.md` — Phase 2 (execution & indicators) articles
- `phase3/manifest.md` — Phase 3 (advanced analytics) articles

NOTE: Some articles are part of multi-part series. We'll record per-article author and publish date when fetching the article HTML for the final import. The manifest contains the Title, original URL, MQL5 article ID (where detected), and suggested tags & phase mapping.

## Next Steps / Suggested workflow
1. Review this manifest for additions/removals and approve the set for Phase 1–3 ingestion.
2. I will fetch each article, parse and capture: (title, author, publish_date, article_id, content HTML, images, code attachments), convert to Markdown, and store in `docs/mql5_handbook/articles/` and image/assets in `docs/mql5_handbook/assets/<article_id>/`.
3. For each article, I will add YAML front-matter with: title, author, original_url, article_id, published_date, tags, phase.
4. Create `docs/mql5_handbook/README.md` with an index and links to all saved articles.
5. Commit the manifest and all content into the repository on a dedicated branch and create a PR.
