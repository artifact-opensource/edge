### Introduction

In our 
[previous article (Part 8)](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/19059)
, we developed an informational dashboard in 
[MetaQuotes Language 5](https://www.metaquotes.net/en/metatrader5/algorithmic-trading/mql5)
 (MQL5) to monitor multi-symbol positions and account metrics. In Part 9, we create a dynamic first run wizard to orient new users the first time they run a program. First-run setup 
[wizards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_(software))
 are essential tools for simplifying the configuration of complex systems, such as Expert Advisors (EAs) in MetaTrader 5, guiding new users through the initial setup and providing an orientation model to ensure optimal performance. In this article, we develop an MQL5 First Run User Setup Wizard for Expert Advisors, featuring a scrollable dashboard with dynamic text, interactive buttons, and a checkbox for streamlined configuration, which will only run once when the program is first launched. We will cover the following topics:
[Understanding the Role and Value of a First Run Setup Guide for Trading Programs](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/19714#para1)
[Implementation in MQL5](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/19714#para2)
[Testing the Setup Wizard](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/19714#para3)
[Conclusion](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/19714#para4)
By the end, you’ll have an interactive MQL5 wizard to enhance EA initialization, ready to customize for your trading needs—let’s dive in!

### Understanding the Role and Value of a First Run Setup Guide for Trading Programs

A first-run setup guide is a crucial feature for trading programs like Expert Advisors (EAs) in 
[MetaTrader 5](https://www.metatrader5.com/)
, providing step-by-step instructions to configure essential settings such as lot sizes, risk levels, and trading filters, helping traders avoid errors that could lead to losses, such as setting an overly large lot size that risks excessive drawdown. Let's say it is more like an orientation that introduces new users to the program schematics and capabilities. Its value lies in simplifying the onboarding process for traders of all experience levels, ensuring proper program setup from the start, and utilizing a mechanism to remember if the guide has been shown, thereby preventing unnecessary prompts during future initializations to optimize the user experience, especially for traders who repeatedly attach programs to charts.
Our approach is to design an intuitive, scrollable dashboard that displays a clear setup guide with visually distinct text (such as highlighted headings and clickable links for support), interactive buttons for user actions, and a checkbox to let traders choose whether to skip the guide in future runs. We will leverage the MQL5 global variable capability to store the user choice in a variable that saves and recalls the trading terminal build number (the software version) and 
[operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)
 (OS) where the program is first run. We will create a centered interface with a header, body, and footer, incorporating dynamic text formatting for readability, scrollable content for comprehensive instructions, and adaptive sizing to fit different screen resolutions. This ensures traders can easily follow steps such as setting risk parameters or enabling AutoTrading, making the setup process seamless and efficient. We will follow the in-built structure for the '
[One Click Trading](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/trading/one_click_trading)
' setup guide as follows.

From the image, you can see the approach we will be taking. We will be adding an optional scaled program image to distinguish it from other programs. In a nutshell, here is a visualization of what we aim to achieve.

### Implementation in MQL5

To create the program in MQL5, open the 
[MetaEditor](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/automated-trading/metaeditor)
, go to the Navigator, locate the Experts folder, click on the "New" tab, and follow the prompts to create the file. Once it is made, in the coding environment, we will need to declare some 
[global variables](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/basis/variables/global)
 that we will use throughout the program.

To set up the Wizard’s foundation, we use 
[global variables](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/basis/variables/global)
 to manage the dashboard layout. We set up coordinates ("g_mainX", "g_mainY" at 50), dimensions ("g_mainWidth" at 500, "g_headerHeight" at 50, "g_footerHeight" at 40), and padding ("g_padding", "g_textPadding" at 10). We also define spacing ("g_spacing" at 0, "g_lineSpacing" at 3), body height limits ("g_minBodyHeight" at 200, "g_maxBodyHeight" at 400), and margin ("g_bottomMargin" at 50). For scrolling, we set variables like "scroll_visible", "scroll_pos", and "slider_height" to 20. Mouse interaction states include "movingStateSlider" and "mlbDownX_Slider". We add hover flags for buttons and checkboxes. We set "ea_name" as "Expert Advisor Setup Wizard" and "MAX_LINES" at 100.
The "ENUM_SCROLLBAR_MODE" 
[enum](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/basis/types/integer/enumeration)
 defines scrollbar behavior ("SCROLL_ALWAYS", "SCROLL_ON_HOVER", "SCROLL_NEVER"), defaulting to "SCROLL_ALWAYS". We 
[define](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/basis/preprosessor/constant)
 constants for object names like "SETUP_MAIN", "SETUP_HEADER_BG", "SCROLL_LEADER", and others for consistent naming of dashboard and scrollbar elements. Finally, we create the "setup_text" string, a comprehensive guide with sections on features, setup instructions, notes, and contact methods formatted with headings and numbered steps, creating a system for organizing the wizard’s interface and content for user interaction. You can modify the positioning or content; we just used arbitrary values. The next thing we will need to configure is the image to be used as the header icon. You can skip this step if you don't want to have it. We will need to convert our image file to a 
[bitmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap)
 (BMP) file. Upon conversion, the image should have properties that depict the following.
![BITMAP FILE IMAGE](https://www.mql5.com/en/assets/MQL5-Trading-Tools-Part-9-Developing-a-First-Run-User-Setup-Wizard-for-Expert-Advisors-with-Scrollable-Guide/Screenshot_2025-09-25_164029.png)
From the image, you can see that our image is a 
[Bitmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap)
 file. You don't have to worry about the size or dimensions since we can scale in any direction we want later when needed. Remember to place the file in the same folder as the program file. What we now need to do is add the file as a resource to the program.

```
#resource "1. Forex Algo-Trader SQ.bmp"
#define resourceImg "::1. Forex Algo-Trader SQ.bmp"


```

We use the "
[#resource](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/runtime/resources)
" directive to include the image file named "1. Forex Algo-Trader SQ.bmp" and define a constant "resourceImg" as "::1. Forex Algo-Trader SQ.bmp" for referencing the image in the program. This will give the wizard’s dashboard a professional and branded user experience. We will now begin the creation of the interface, and we will need some helper functions. Let us define functions to create the necessary rectangle labels, texts, images, and buttons.

```

```

Here, we implement the core graphical components for the interactive dashboard. First, we develop the "createRecLabel" function, which creates a rectangle label (
[OBJ_RECTANGLE_LABEL](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object/obj_rectangle_label)
) with specified coordinates, size, background color, border width, type (
[BORDER_FLAT](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object_property#enum_border_type)
), style (
[STYLE_SOLID](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/indicatorconstants/drawstyles#enum_line_style)
), and corner (
[CORNER_LEFT_UPPER](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_basecorner)
) using the 
[ObjectCreate](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/objectcreate)
 and 
[ObjectSetInteger](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/objectsetinteger)
 functions, logging errors with 
[Print](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/print)
 if creation fails, and setting it to non-selectable foreground. Then, we implement the "createButton" function, which creates a button (
[OBJ_BUTTON](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object/obj_button)
) with text, color, font size, font (default "Arial"), background, border, and corner, using the same format.
Next, we create the "createLabel" function, which generates a text label (
[OBJ_LABEL](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object/obj_label)
) with text, color, font size, font, corner, and anchor (
[ANCHOR_LEFT_UPPER](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_anchorpoint)
) using similar object creation and property-setting calls, logging errors if needed. Finally, we build the "createBitmapLabel" function, which creates a bitmap label (
[OBJ_BITMAP_LABEL](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object/obj_bitmap_label)
) for images with coordinates, size, bitmap path, color, and corner, using "ObjectCreate" and setting properties to ensure non-selectable foreground display, logging any failures. This will make sure we create a system for rendering the wizard’s visual elements, such as containers, buttons, text, and images. 
We can proceed to create some utility functions to help us calculate the height of the dashboard because we want to dynamically center, get the text fonts dynamically as per the screen resolution, so that some texts don't appear too small or too big on different devices, and truncate the text if it is long to avoid potential overflow.

```
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Calculate font size based on screen DPI                          |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
int getFontSizeByDPI(int baseFontSize, int baseDPI = 96) {
   int currentDPI = (int)TerminalInfoInteger(TERMINAL_SCREEN_DPI); //--- Retrieve current screen DPI
   int scaledFontSize = (int)(baseFontSize * (double)baseDPI / currentDPI); //--- Calculate scaled font size
   return scaledFontSize;                                          //--- Return scaled font size
}

//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Calculate dashboard dimensions                                   |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
void CalculateDashboardDimensions() {
   long chart_width = ChartGetInteger(0, CHART_WIDTH_IN_PIXELS);   //--- Get chart width
   long chart_height = ChartGetInteger(0, CHART_HEIGHT_IN_PIXELS); //--- Get chart height
   g_mainX = (int)((chart_width - g_mainWidth) / 2); //--- Center main container horizontally
   int available_height = (int)(chart_height - g_mainY - g_bottomMargin - g_headerHeight - g_footerHeight - 2 * g_spacing); //--- Calculate available height
   g_displayHeight = MathMin(g_maxBodyHeight, MathMax(g_minBodyHeight, available_height)); //--- Set display height
   g_mainHeight = g_headerHeight + g_displayHeight + g_footerHeight + 2 * g_spacing; //--- Calculate main container height
}

//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Truncate string                                                  |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
string truncateString(string valueStr, int startPos, int lengthStr = -1, int threshHold = 0, bool isEllipsis = false) {
   string result = valueStr;                                        //--- Initialize result
   if (StringLen(valueStr) > threshHold && threshHold > 0) {        //--- Check if truncation needed
      result = StringSubstr(valueStr, startPos, lengthStr);         //--- Extract substring
      if (isEllipsis) result += "...";                              //--- Add ellipsis if needed
   }
   return result;                                                   //--- Return truncated string
}

```

Here, we implement utility functions to ensure adaptive sizing and text formatting. We develop the "getFontSizeByDPI" function, which retrieves the screen 
[DPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch)
 (Dots Per Inch) using 
[TerminalInfoInteger](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/check/terminalinfointeger)
 with 
[TERMINAL_SCREEN_DPI](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/terminalstatus#enum_terminal_info_integer)
, calculates a scaled font size by adjusting the base font size relative to a standard DPI (96) using a simple ratio, and returns the result for consistent text display across devices.
Then, we create the "CalculateDashboardDimensions" function, which gets the chart’s width and height via 
[ChartGetInteger](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/chart_operations/chartgetinteger)
 with 
[CHART_WIDTH_IN_PIXELS](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/chartconstants/enum_chart_property#enum_chart_property_integer)
 and "CHART_HEIGHT_IN_PIXELS", centers the main container horizontally by setting "g_mainX" to half the difference between chart width and "g_mainWidth", computes available height by subtracting "g_mainY", "g_bottomMargin", "g_headerHeight", "g_footerHeight", and twice "g_spacing" from chart height, sets "g_displayHeight" within "g_minBodyHeight" and "g_maxBodyHeight" bounds using 
[MathMin](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/math/mathmin)
 and 
[MathMax](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/math/mathmax)
, and calculates "g_mainHeight" as the sum of header, body, footer heights, and spacing.
Finally, we implement the "truncateString" function, which returns the input string unchanged if its length is below a threshold or zero, otherwise extracts a substring with 
[StringSubstr](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/strings/stringsubstr)
 from "startPos" for "lengthStr" characters, adding an ellipsis if specified, to manage text overflow. With these functions, we can begin the implementation by creating the main dashboard. We will house its logic in a function for modularization.

```
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Show the setup dashboard                                         |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
void ShowDashboard() {
   checkbox_checked = false;                         //--- Reset checkbox state
   createRecLabel(SETUP_MAIN, g_mainX, g_mainY, g_mainWidth, g_mainHeight, C'20,20,20', 1, C'40,40,40', BORDER_FLAT, STYLE_SOLID, CORNER_LEFT_UPPER); //--- Create main container
   createRecLabel(SETUP_HEADER_BG, g_mainX, g_mainY, g_mainWidth, g_headerHeight, C'45,45,45', 1, C'60,60,60', BORDER_FLAT, STYLE_SOLID, CORNER_LEFT_UPPER); //--- Create header background

}
```

We implement the "ShowDashboard" function, and first, we reset the checkbox state to false, ensuring a clean start for user interaction. Then, we call "createRecLabel" to draw the main container ("SETUP_MAIN") at coordinates "g_mainX" and "g_mainY" with dimensions "g_mainWidth" and "g_mainHeight", using a dark gray background (C'20,20,20'), a 1-pixel border (C'40,40,40'), flat border type, solid style, and top-left corner alignment.
Next, we use "createRecLabel" to create the header background ("SETUP_HEADER_BG") at the same x-coordinate and "g_mainY", spanning "g_mainWidth" and "g_headerHeight", with a slightly lighter gray background (C'45,45,45') and border (C'60,60,60'), maintaining consistent styling, rendering the foundational visual structure of the wizard’s dashboard. We now need to call this function in the 
[OnInit](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/event_handlers/oninit)
 event handler.

```
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Expert initialization function                                   |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
int OnInit() {
   int build = (int)TerminalInfoInteger(TERMINAL_BUILD); //--- Get terminal build number
   string os = TerminalInfoString(TERMINAL_OS_VERSION);  //--- Get operating system version
   StringReplace(os, " ", "_");                          //--- Replace spaces with underscores
   StringReplace(os, ".", "_");                          //--- Replace dots with underscores
   StringReplace(os, ",", "_");                          //--- Replace commas with underscores
   GV_SETUP = "EA_Setup_" + IntegerToString(build) + "_" + os; //--- Set global variable name
   CalculateDashboardDimensions();                       //--- Calculate dashboard dimensions
   if (!GlobalVariableCheck(GV_SETUP)) {                 //--- Check if global variable exists
      Print("Global variable '" + GV_SETUP + "' not found. Creating new one with value FALSE (0.0)."); //--- Log variable creation
      GlobalVariableSet(GV_SETUP, 0.0);                  //--- Set variable to false
      ShowDashboard();                                   //--- Display dashboard
   } else {                                              //--- Variable exists
      double val = GlobalVariableGet(GV_SETUP);          //--- Get variable value
      if (val == 1.0) {                                  //--- Check if set to never show
         // No dashboard
      } else {                                           //--- Show dashboard
         ShowDashboard();                                //--- Display dashboard
      }
   }
   ChartSetInteger(0, CHART_EVENT_MOUSE_MOVE, true);     //--- Enable mouse move events
   ChartSetInteger(0, CHART_EVENT_MOUSE_WHEEL, true);    //--- Enable mouse wheel events
   ChartSetInteger(0, CHART_MOUSE_SCROLL, true);         //--- Enable chart scrolling
   return(INIT_SUCCEEDED);                               //--- Return initialization success
}
```

We proceed to implement the initialization logic to manage the display behavior in the 
[OnInit](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/event_handlers/oninit)
 function, where we retrieve the MetaTrader 5 terminal build number using 
[TerminalInfoInteger](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/check/terminalinfointeger)
 with 
[TERMINAL_BUILD](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/terminalstatus#enum_terminal_info_integer)
 and the operating system version with 
[TerminalInfoString](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/check/terminalinfostring)
 using 
[TERMINAL_OS_VERSION](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/terminalstatus#enum_terminal_info_string)
, replacing spaces, dots, and commas in the OS string with underscores via 
[StringReplace](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/strings/StringReplace)
 to create a clean global variable name ("GV_SETUP") formatted as "EA_Setup_<build>_<OS>" You could use any other like magic number or program name and version number, it just felt genius and unique to use this combination. We call "CalculateDashboardDimensions" to set up the dashboard’s layout based on chart dimensions.
Then, we check if the global variable exists with 
[GlobalVariableCheck](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/globals/globalvariablecheck)
; if not, we log its creation with "Print", set it to 0.0 (false) using 
[GlobalVariableSet](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/globals/globalvariableset)
, and display the dashboard with "ShowDashboard". If the variable exists, we retrieve its value with 
[GlobalVariableGet](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/globals/globalvariableget)
, showing the dashboard only if the value is not 1.0 (indicating the user chose not to show it again). Finally, we enable mouse move and wheel events with 
[ChartSetInteger](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/chart_operations/chartsetinteger)
 using 
[CHART_EVENT_MOUSE_MOVE](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/chartconstants/enum_chart_property#enum_chart_property_integer)
, "CHART_EVENT_MOUSE_WHEEL", and "CHART_MOUSE_SCROLL" to support interactive features, which will be helpful in the 
[OnChartEvent](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/event_handlers/onchartevent)
 event handler, and return 
[INIT_SUCCEEDED](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/basis/function/events#enum_init_retcode)
 for successful initialization. Upon compilation, we get the following outcome.
![BASE DASHBOARD WITH HEADER](https://www.mql5.com/en/assets/MQL5-Trading-Tools-Part-9-Developing-a-First-Run-User-Setup-Wizard-for-Expert-Advisors-with-Scrollable-Guide/Screenshot_2025-09-25_174130.png)
Since we now have a header section, let us add the image file to it. We will need to scale the image, so let's define the functions to do the heavy lifting, then we can call them to scale our image file.

Here, we implement image processing functions to enhance the visual quality. First, we develop the "ScaleImage" function, which resizes an image by creating a new pixel array with 
[ArrayResize](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/array/arrayresize)
 for the target dimensions ("new_width" x "new_height"), iterating through each pixel, mapping coordinates to the original image using proportional scaling, and calling "BicubicInterpolate" to compute the interpolated pixel value, storing it in the scaled array before copying back to the original array with the 
[ArrayCopy](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/array/arraycopy)
 function.
Then, we create the "BicubicInterpolate" function, which calculates a pixel’s color at non-integer coordinates ("x", "y") by selecting a 4x4 neighborhood of pixels, clamping indices with 
[MathMin](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/math/mathmin)
 and 
[MathMax](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/math/mathmax)
 to stay within the image bounds, extracting 
[ARGB components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGBA_color_model)
 with "GetArgb", interpolating each component using "BicubicInterpolateComponent", and combining them into a final pixel value with 
[bitwise](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/basis/operations/bit)
 operations. Next, we implement "BicubicInterpolateComponent", which applies bicubic interpolation to a single color component by calculating cubic weights for x and y fractional coordinates, computing intermediate y-values from a 4x4 grid, and combining them with y-weights, clamping the result between 0 and 255. Finally, the "GetArgb" function extracts alpha, red, green, and blue components from a pixel using 
[bitwise shifts](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/basis/operations/bit)
 and masks. This will adapt a smoothly scaling approach for our images to fit the dashboard or designated area. We can now call this function to scale our resource image and display it.

```
uint img_pixels[];                                       //--- Declare pixel array for image
uint orig_width = 0, orig_height = 0;                    //--- Initialize image dimensions
bool image_loaded = ResourceReadImage(resourceImg, img_pixels, orig_width, orig_height); //--- Load image resource
if (image_loaded && orig_width > 0 && orig_height > 0) { //--- Check image load success
   ScaleImage(img_pixels, (int)orig_width, (int)orig_height, 40, 40); //--- Scale image to 40x40
   g_scaled_image_resource = "::SetupHeaderImageScaled"; //--- Set scaled image resource name
   if (ResourceCreate(g_scaled_image_resource, img_pixels, 40, 40, 0, 0, 40, COLOR_FORMAT_ARGB_NORMALIZE)) { //--- Create scaled resource
      createBitmapLabel(SETUP_HEADER_IMAGE, g_mainX + 5, g_mainY + (g_headerHeight - 40)/2, 40, 40, g_scaled_image_resource, clrWhite, CORNER_LEFT_UPPER); //--- Create scaled image label
   } else {                                              //--- Handle resource creation failure
      Print("Failed to create scaled image resource");   //--- Log failure
      createBitmapLabel(SETUP_HEADER_IMAGE, g_mainX + 5, g_mainY + (g_headerHeight - 40)/2, 40, 40, resourceImg, clrWhite, CORNER_LEFT_UPPER); //--- Use original image
   }
} else {                                                 //--- Handle image load failure
   Print("Failed to load original image resource");      //--- Log failure
   createBitmapLabel(SETUP_HEADER_IMAGE, g_mainX + 5, g_mainY + (g_headerHeight - 40)/2, 40, 40, resourceImg, clrWhite, CORNER_LEFT_UPPER); //--- Use original image
}

```

To implement the image loading and scaling logic, we declare a pixel array "img_pixels" and initialize dimensions "orig_width" and "orig_height" to zero, then load the resource image with "ResourceReadImage" using "resourceImg", checking if successful ("image_loaded" and dimensions > 0); if true, we call "ScaleImage" to resize to 40x40 pixels - which you can modify, set "g_scaled_image_resource" to "::SetupHeaderImageScaled", and create a new resource with 
[ResourceCreate](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/resourcecreate)
 in ARGB format, followed by "createBitmapLabel" to display the scaled image at the header’s position with white color. If resource creation fails, we log the instance and fall back to the original image; if the load fails, we log and use the original "resourceImg" directly with the "createBitmapLabel" function. Upon compilation, we get the following outcome.

Now that we have the image file ready, we move on to implementing the other core elements as follows.

}

```

Here, we implement the remaining dashboard components for the Wizard to complete its user interface. We truncate the program's name to 20 characters with "truncateString" for readability and create a title label ("SETUP_HEADER_TITLE") with "createLabel" at calculated coordinates, using a DPI-adjusted font size from "getFontSizeByDPI" (base 14) and "Arial Bold". Next, we add a subtitle label ("SETUP_HEADER_SUBTITLE") with fixed text and a smaller DPI-adjusted font size (base 10), followed by a header cancel button ("SETUP_HEADER_CANCEL") using a 
[Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode)
 cross (0x274C) in "Arial Rounded MT Bold". Here is its description.
![CROSS MARK DETAILS](https://www.mql5.com/en/assets/MQL5-Trading-Tools-Part-9-Developing-a-First-Run-User-Setup-Wizard-for-Expert-Advisors-with-Scrollable-Guide/Screenshot_2025-09-25_180228.png)
We calculate the body’s y-position ("bodyY") and create its background ("SETUP_BODY_BG") with "createRecLabel" using a dark gray background (C'25,25,25') and border, spanning "g_mainWidth" and "g_displayHeight". Then, we compute the footer’s y-position ("footerY") and create its background ("SETUP_FOOTER_BG") with a lighter gray, followed by a checkbox background ("SETUP_CHECKBOX_BG") as a 20x20 square, a checkbox label ("SETUP_CHECKBOX_LABEL") with an empty 
[Wingdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingdings)
 character, and its text ("SETUP_CHECKBOX_TEXT") stating "Do not show this guide again" in "Calibri Bold". We add OK and Cancel buttons ("SETUP_OK_BUTTON", "SETUP_CANCEL_BUTTON") with "createButton" at DPI-adjusted font size (base 12), using consistent gray colors. Finally, we loop to create up to "MAX_LINES" text labels ("Setup_ResponseLine_") with "createLabel", initially hidden off-screen, for dynamic text display. This creates a system for rendering the wizard’s interactive and visually cohesive dashboard. We get the following outcome upon running the program.
![WIZARD ENHANCED ELEMENTS](https://www.mql5.com/en/assets/MQL5-Trading-Tools-Part-9-Developing-a-First-Run-User-Setup-Wizard-for-Expert-Advisors-with-Scrollable-Guide/Screenshot_2025-09-25_180512.png)
Since we now have the dashboard with the basic elements, we need to update the display to show the wizard's designated labels. Since having rich multi-line text labels in MQL5 is not as easy as there is no direct way of achieving that, we will need to use a text wrapping approach.

```

Here, we implement text formatting and color-coding logic to enhance the readability of the guide. In the "GetLineColor" function, we assign colors based on content: empty lines get an invisible dark gray (C'25,25,25'), email addresses use light red (C'255,100,100'), group links use light purple (C'150,100,200'), author links and other uniform resource locator (
[URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL)
) use light blue (C'100,150,255'), instruction lines starting with "1. " to "5. " (excluding the heading) use light yellow (C'255,200,100'), and all others default to white. You can define any of your choice; we just included this to provide an insight into how rich text encoding can be achieved.
In the "WrapText" function, we split the input text into paragraphs using 
[StringSplit](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/strings/StringSplit)
 on newlines, set the font with 
[TextSetFont](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/textsetfont)
, and for each paragraph, retrieve its color with "GetLineColor", adding empty paragraphs as a space with invisible color. We split paragraphs into words with "StringSplit", building lines by adding words if they fit within "maxWidth" and a 60-character limit, though the maximum limit is 63, using 
[TextGetSize](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/textgetsize)
, otherwise starting a new line; for oversized words, we split character by character, adding segments to new lines if they exceed limits, ensuring each line is stored in "wrappedLines" with its color in "wrappedColors" using the 
[ArrayResize](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/array/arrayresize)
 function. With this function, we can update the display. We will ensure that logic is a function.

To implement text rendering and scrolling logic to display the guide dynamically, in the "TextGetHeight" function, we set the font and size with 
[TextSetFont](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/textsetfont)
 and use 
[TextGetSize](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/textgetsize)
 to calculate the height of a sample character, returning it for consistent line spacing. The "IsHeading" function identifies headings by checking for empty lines, colons at the end, or specific guide section titles (e.g., "Key Features"), returning true if matched. In the "UpdateBodyDisplay" function, we calculate the text area’s position ("textX", "textY") and width ("fullMaxWidth") using padding and container dimensions, set the font to Arial with a DPI-adjusted size from "getFontSizeByDPI", and compute line height with "TextGetHeight" plus "g_lineSpacing", storing it in "g_adjustedLineHeight".
We wrap the guide text with "WrapText" if not already done, calculate total text height ("g_total_height"), and determine scrollbar visibility based on "ScrollbarMode" and text overflow, reserving 16 pixels for the scrollbar if needed and rewrapping text accordingly. We compute the starting line from "scroll_pos", update visible text labels with 
[ObjectSetString](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/objectsetstring)
 and 
[ObjectSetInteger](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/ObjectSetInteger)
 for position, color (blue for headings via "IsHeading"), and font, hide unused labels, and redraw the chart. When we call this function in the function to show the dashboard, we get the following outcome.

We can see we have the display ready with the text fitting perfectly in the display area. What we need to do is fetch the logic for displaying the scrollbar when needed.

To implement the scrollbar functionality to enable smooth navigation of the setup guide, we create the "CreateScrollbar" function and in it we calculate the scrollbar’s position and dimensions based on the body’s y-coordinate ("bodyY"), setting "scrollbar_x" to the right edge of the main container and using a 16-pixel width, creating a leader rectangle ("SCROLL_LEADER") with "createRecLabel" for the scrollbar track, and up/down buttons ("SCROLL_UP_REC", "SCROLL_DOWN_REC") with labels ("SCROLL_UP_LABEL", "SCROLL_DOWN_LABEL") using Webdings arrows (0x35, 0x36). We call "CalculateSliderHeight" to determine the slider’s height based on the visible text ratio, creating the slider ("SCROLL_SLIDER") with "createRecLabel". The "DeleteScrollbar" function removes all scrollbar objects ("SCROLL_LEADER", etc.) using 
[ObjectDelete](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/objectdelete)
 and redraws the chart.
In "CalculateSliderHeight", we compute the slider height as a proportion of the display height to total text height, ensuring a minimum of 20 pixels. The "UpdateSliderPosition" function adjusts the slider’s y-position using a scroll ratio derived from "scroll_pos" and "g_max_scroll", setting it with "ObjectSetInteger". In "UpdateButtonColors", we update the up/down button colors based on scroll position and hover state for dynamic visual feedback. The "ScrollUp" and "ScrollDown" functions adjust "scroll_pos" by "g_adjustedLineHeight", clamping within bounds, and call "UpdateBodyDisplay", "UpdateSliderPosition", and "UpdateButtonColors" if the scrollbar is visible, ensuring seamless scrolling. We can now call these functions inside the display update function to add the scrollbar. Here is the approach we use to achieve that.

```
int num_visible_lines = g_visible_height / g_adjustedLineHeight; //--- Calculate visible lines
g_max_scroll = MathMax(0, (numLines - num_visible_lines) * g_adjustedLineHeight); //--- Calculate max scroll
bool prev_scroll_visible = scroll_visible;       //--- Store previous scrollbar state
scroll_visible = should_show_scrollbar;          //--- Update scrollbar visibility
if (scroll_visible != prev_scroll_visible) {     //--- Check scrollbar state change
   if (scroll_visible) {                         //--- Show scrollbar
      CreateScrollbar();                         //--- Create scrollbar
   } else {                                      //--- Hide scrollbar
      DeleteScrollbar();                         //--- Delete scrollbar
   }
}
scroll_pos = MathMax(0, MathMin(scroll_pos, g_max_scroll)); //--- Clamp scroll position
if (scroll_visible) {                            //--- Update scrollbar
   slider_height = CalculateSliderHeight();      //--- Calculate slider height
   ObjectSetInteger(0, SCROLL_SLIDER, OBJPROP_YSIZE, slider_height); //--- Set slider height
   UpdateSliderPosition();                       //--- Update slider position
   UpdateButtonColors();                         //--- Update button colors
}

```

Inside the "UpdateBodyDisplay" function, we calculate the number of visible lines by dividing "g_visible_height" by "g_adjustedLineHeight" and determine the maximum scroll distance ("g_max_scroll") as the excess text height beyond visible lines, using 
[MathMax](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/math/mathmax)
 to avoid negative values. We store the previous scrollbar visibility state in "prev_scroll_visible", update "scroll_visible" based on whether a scrollbar is needed, and if the state changes, call "CreateScrollbar" to draw the scrollbar or "DeleteScrollbar" to remove it. We clamp "scroll_pos" between 0 and "g_max_scroll" using "MathMax" and 
[MathMin](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/math/mathmin)
 to prevent overflow. If the scrollbar is visible, we update "slider_height" with "CalculateSliderHeight", set the slider’s height with 
[ObjectSetInteger](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/objectsetinteger)
 for "SCROLL_SLIDER", and call "UpdateSliderPosition" and "UpdateButtonColors" to refresh the scrollbar’s appearance and position. When we compile, we get the following outcome.
![SCROLLBAR ENABLED](https://www.mql5.com/en/assets/MQL5-Trading-Tools-Part-9-Developing-a-First-Run-User-Setup-Wizard-for-Expert-Advisors-with-Scrollable-Guide/Screenshot_2025-09-25_203431.png)
From the image, we can see that the dashboard elements are fully created. We now need to make sure that we discard the dashboard when we log out or deinitialize the program.

```
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Delete the dashboard                                             |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
void DeleteDashboard() {
   string objects[] = {                             //--- Define dashboard objects
      SETUP_MAIN, SETUP_HEADER_BG, SETUP_HEADER_IMAGE, SETUP_HEADER_TITLE, SETUP_HEADER_SUBTITLE, SETUP_HEADER_CANCEL,
      SETUP_BODY_BG, SETUP_FOOTER_BG, SETUP_CHECKBOX_BG, SETUP_CHECKBOX_LABEL, SETUP_CHECKBOX_TEXT,
      SETUP_OK_BUTTON, SETUP_CANCEL_BUTTON, SCROLL_LEADER, SCROLL_UP_REC, SCROLL_UP_LABEL,
      SCROLL_DOWN_REC, SCROLL_DOWN_LABEL, SCROLL_SLIDER
   };
   for (int i = 0; i < ArraySize(objects); i++) {   //--- Iterate through objects
      ObjectDelete(0, objects[i]);                  //--- Delete object
   }
   int total = ObjectsTotal(0);                     //--- Get total objects
   for (int j = total - 1; j >= 0; j--) {           //--- Iterate through remaining objects
      string name = ObjectName(0, j);               //--- Get object name
      if (StringFind(name, "Setup_ResponseLine_") == 0) { //--- Check for text lines
         ObjectDelete(0, name);                     //--- Delete text line
      }
   }
   ChartRedraw();                                   //--- Redraw chart
}

//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Expert deinitialization function                                 |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
void OnDeinit(const int reason) {
   DeleteDashboard();                                //--- Remove dashboard objects
   if (StringLen(g_scaled_image_resource) > 0) {     //--- Check if scaled image exists
      ResourceFree(g_scaled_image_resource);         //--- Free scaled image resource
   }
}

```

Here, we implement cleanup functionality for the Wizard to ensure proper resource management. In the "DeleteDashboard" function, we define an array of dashboard object names, including main container, header, body, footer, buttons, checkbox, and scrollbar components, and iterate through them using 
[ObjectDelete](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/objectdelete)
 to remove each from the chart. We then loop through all remaining chart objects with 
[ObjectsTotal](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/objectstotal)
 and 
[ObjectName](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/objectname)
, deleting any text line objects starting with "Setup_ResponseLine_" using "ObjectDelete", and redraw the chart with 
[ChartRedraw](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/chart_operations/ChartRedraw)
 for a clean display. In the "OnDeinit" function, we call "DeleteDashboard" to remove all dashboard elements and check if a scaled image resource exists ("
[StringLen(g_scaled_image_resource)](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/strings/stringlen)
 > 0"), freeing it with 
[ResourceFree](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/resourcefree)
 to release memory. We can now move on to breathing life into the dashboard. We want it so that when we click on the buttons, they do their designated calls, and hover effects to show the state of the cursor. We will need a function to do that for simplicity.

Here, we implement hover effects for the interactive elements that we have created to enhance user feedback. We create the "UpdateHoverEffects" function and in it we check mouse coordinates ("mouseX", "mouseY") against the positions and sizes of the OK button ("SETUP_OK_BUTTON"), Cancel button ("SETUP_CANCEL_BUTTON"), checkbox ("SETUP_CHECKBOX_BG"), header cancel button ("SETUP_HEADER_CANCEL"), and scrollbar components ("SCROLL_UP_REC", "SCROLL_DOWN_REC", "SCROLL_SLIDER") using 
[ObjectGetInteger](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/ObjectGetInteger)
 for their dimensions.
For each element, we detect hover by verifying if the mouse is within its bounds, updating respective hover states ("ok_button_hovered", "cancel_button_hovered", etc.) if changed, and adjust colors with 
[ObjectSetInteger](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/objectsetinteger)
: OK button uses green shades (C'40,80,40'), Cancel button uses red shades (C'80,40,40'), checkbox uses green when checked (C'0,150,0') or gray (C'70,70,70'), header cancel shifts to bright red (C'255,100,100'), and scrollbar buttons/slider use varying grays (C'70,70,70' or C'100,100,100') based on hover and scroll position ("scroll_pos"). All these colors can be modified as per your liking. We just used arbitrary values again to gain an edge over visual feedback. We redraw the chart with 
[ChartRedraw](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/chart_operations/ChartRedraw)
 after each update. We now need to just implement this in the 
[OnChartEvent](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/event_handlers/onchartevent)
 event handler, which takes care of all chart events, but in our case, we are interested in the mouse movement and click events.

Finally, in the 
[OnChartEvent](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/event_handlers/onchartevent)
 function, we handle click events (
[CHARTEVENT_OBJECT_CLICK](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/chartconstants/enum_chartevents)
) by checking the clicked object ("sparam"): if it’s the header cancel ("SETUP_HEADER_CANCEL") or Cancel button ("SETUP_CANCEL_BUTTON"), we set the global variable "GV_SETUP" to 0.0 with 
[GlobalVariableSet](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/globals/globalvariableset)
 and remove the dashboard with "DeleteDashboard"; if it’s the OK button ("SETUP_OK_BUTTON"), we set "GV_SETUP" to 1.0 if the checkbox is checked ("checkbox_checked") or 0.0 otherwise, then remove the dashboard; if it’s the checkbox components ("SETUP_CHECKBOX_BG", "SETUP_CHECKBOX_TEXT", "SETUP_CHECKBOX_LABEL"), we toggle "checkbox_checked", update the checkbox label to a checkmark (Unicode 252) or space with 
[ObjectSetString](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/objectsetstring)
, set the text color to light blue (C'173,216,230') or white with 
[ObjectSetInteger](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/objectsetinteger)
, and adjust the checkbox background to green (C'0,128,0') or gray (C'60,60,60'). MQL5 provides a detailed list of the Wingdings font characters, and that is what we used. You can use any of your choice or a different approach. Here is a visualization of the possible 
[MQL5 Wingdings](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/wingdings)
 characters you can use.
![MQL5 WINGDINGS](https://www.mql5.com/en/assets/MQL5-Trading-Tools-Part-9-Developing-a-First-Run-User-Setup-Wizard-for-Expert-Advisors-with-Scrollable-Guide/C_MQL5_WINGDINGS.png)
For scroll up ("SCROLL_UP_REC", "SCROLL_UP_LABEL") or down ("SCROLL_DOWN_REC", "SCROLL_DOWN_LABEL") clicks, we call "ScrollUp" or "ScrollDown". For mouse move events (
[CHARTEVENT_MOUSE_MOVE](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/chartconstants/enum_chartevents)
), we calculate the body area, update "mouse_in_body", and call "UpdateHoverEffects" with "mouseX" and "mouseY"; we detect slider drag start ("MouseState" 1) by checking if the mouse is over "SCROLL_SLIDER", setting "movingStateSlider" and storing mouse positions, and during drag, adjust the slider’s y-position with 
[ObjectSetInteger](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/objects/objectsetinteger)
, update "scroll_pos" based on the scroll ratio, and refresh the display with "UpdateBodyDisplay". On mouse release ("MouseState" 0), we snap "scroll_pos" to the nearest line, reset the slider state, and re-enable chart scrolling with the 
[ChartSetInteger](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/chart_operations/chartsetinteger)
 function. For mouse wheel events (
[CHARTEVENT_MOUSE_WHEEL](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/chartconstants/enum_chartevents)
), we adjust "scroll_pos" based on wheel direction and notches, clamp it within "g_max_scroll", and update the display and scrollbar. When we compile, we get the following outcome.
![FINAL WIZARD WITH FULL FUNCTIONALITY](https://www.mql5.com/en/assets/MQL5-Trading-Tools-Part-9-Developing-a-First-Run-User-Setup-Wizard-for-Expert-Advisors-with-Scrollable-Guide/Screenshot_2025-09-25_205754.png)
From the image, we can see that the dashboard is now fully functional and interactive. When we click on the okay button, we should get a global variable set. To access the global variable, you need to click on "Tools" then "Global Variables" or simply press F3 on your keyboard. Here is a complete visualization.
![GLOBAL VARIABLE SETUP](https://www.mql5.com/en/assets/MQL5-Trading-Tools-Part-9-Developing-a-First-Run-User-Setup-Wizard-for-Expert-Advisors-with-Scrollable-Guide/Screenshot_2025-09-25_210430.png)
From the images, we can see that we have correctly set up the wizard with all the objectives achieved. What now remains is testing the workability of the project, and that is handled in the preceding section.

### Testing the Setup Wizard

We did the testing, and below is the compiled visualization in a single 
[Graphics Interchange Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF)
 (GIF) bitmap image format.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, we’ve developed a first-run user setup Wizard for Expert Advisors in MQL5, creating an interactive dashboard with a scrollable guide, dynamic text formatting, and user controls like buttons and a checkbox to streamline program configuration in 
[MetaTrader 5](https://www.metatrader5.com/)
. The tool enhances trader onboarding by providing clear instructions and a mechanism to skip future displays, ensuring efficient setup and adaptability across screen settings. It equips you to simplify program initialization by providing custom one-time user insights, ready for further customization in your trading toolkit. Happy trading!

[From Novice to Expert: Backend Operations Monitor using MQL5](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/19649)

Using a ready-made solution in trading without concerning yourself with the internal workings of the system may sound comforting, but this is not always the case for developers. Eventually, an upgrade, misperformance, or unexpected error will arise, and it becomes essential to trace exactly where the issue originates to diagnose and resolve it quickly. Today’s discussion focuses on uncovering what normally happens behind the scenes of a trading Expert Advisor, and on developing a custom dedicated class for displaying and logging backend processes using MQL5. This gives both developers and traders the ability to quickly locate errors, monitor behavior, and access diagnostic information specific to each EA.

[Price Action Analysis Toolkit Development (Part 42): Interactive Chart Testing with Button Logic and Statistical Levels](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/19697)

In a world where speed and precision matter, analysis tools need to be as smart as the markets we trade. This article presents an EA built on button logic—an interactive system that instantly transforms raw price data into meaningful statistical levels. With a single click, it calculates and displays mean, deviation, percentiles, and more, turning advanced analytics into clear on-chart signals. It highlights the zones where price is most likely to bounce, retrace, or break, making analysis both faster and more practical.

[Cyclic Parthenogenesis Algorithm (CPA)](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/16877)

The article considers a new population optimization algorithm - Cyclic Parthenogenesis Algorithm (CPA), inspired by the unique reproductive strategy of aphids. The algorithm combines two reproduction mechanisms — parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction — and also utilizes the colonial structure of the population with the possibility of migration between colonies. The key features of the algorithm are adaptive switching between different reproductive strategies and a system of information exchange between colonies through the flight mechanism.
